### Projects

#### Point of Sale Rollout (2023-2025)

I was heavily involved in rolling out a new Point of Sale for Woodstock's Pizza.  Tasks ranged from the initial buildout of the menu, deploying hardware on site, and long term training and support.  In total, I was apart of rolling out four locations, one of which I was project lead.  Long term support involved creating and editing menu items and coupons, ensuring online ordering functionality, and rolling out new pricing annually.

#### Payroll Software Integration (2024-2025)

I developed software for an in-house integration between our Point of Sale system and our Payroll System.  I used our Point of Sale's API to generate time clock data to be ingested by Payroll.  I worked closely with our POS and Payroll vendors, as well as our Accounting department to accomplish this project.  This automated the bulk of payroll, ensuring timely bi-weekly payroll.
